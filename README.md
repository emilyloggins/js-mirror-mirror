Create an input field in your DOM. Give it an id of message.
Create two article elements with unique id values. Use Flexbox to display them in a row, each taking 50% of the width of the browser.
Give each article a different border color.
Write an event listener that listens for the keyup event on the input field.
The event handler function should update the textContent property of both sections.
